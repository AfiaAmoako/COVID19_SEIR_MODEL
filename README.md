# COVID19_SEIR_MODEL
This applies a simple SEIR compartmental model to model the current coronavirus epidemic with intervention impacts adapted from Wang, H., Wang, Z., Dong, Y., Chang, R., Xu, C., Yu, X., Zhang, S., Tsamlag, L., Shang, M., Huang, J., Wang, Y., Xu, G., Shen, T., Zhang, X., & Cai, Y. (2020). Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China. Cell Discovery, 6(1), 1â€“8. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0
